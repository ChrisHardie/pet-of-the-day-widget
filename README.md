## Description

This plugin creates a widget to display an adoptable "pet of the day" for a given US or Canadian postal code, powered by Adopt-a-Pet.com.

When a user clicks on the pet image or the details button, they'll be taken to that pet's profile on Adopt-a-Pet.com in a new browser window or tab.

Use this plugin to encourage local pet adoption and adoptable pet awareness on your WordPress site.
